											<h2>My research</h2>
										</header>
										<p>            With the launch of the JWST an avalanche of data on the high redshift Universe 
											is currently being taken. For example, F. D’Eugenio et al. 2023 have observed the most 
											distant nebular-line detection to date at z = 12.5 with JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy. 
											It is important therefore that we have the best theoretical models to understand this data,
											and this is the focus of my research. 
											One way of comparing models with data is to forward model the emission from theoretical galaxies 
											and compare in this observer space. </p>

								<h3>Using white dwarf lensing to resolve accretion flows</h3>
								<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Newman, Sophie L.; Middleton, Matthew J.; McMaster, Adam</p>
								<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Microlensing is one of the most powerful tools for probing the nature of dark halo objects and the sources they lens. As our nearest massive galaxy, M31 provides a rich source population with many potential lenses in its halo crossing our field of view at any one time. In this paper we explore the probability that X-ray sources in M31 will be lensed by white dwarfs in M31's halo. We find an expected lensing rate of 2.6/year within the mean archival Swift XRT field-of-view, and 6.3/year for the whole galaxy. For X-ray emitting sources harboring accreting neutron stars and black holes, we find that microlensing offers a unique opportunity to constrain the properties of the inner accretion flow. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to recover both the spin of the black hole and the temperature profile of the accretion disk by discerning their effects upon the profile of the microlensing magnification. We show that these parameters have a significant effect on the shape of the light curve, with the effect of spin being more pronounced at smaller impact parameters and higher energies, while the effect of the temperature profile is larger at lower energies and larger impact parameters. This suggests that multi-band observations of a single lensing event could be used to robustly constrain both parameters.</p>

								<h3>Cloudy-Maraston: Integrating nebular continuum and line emission with the Maraston stellar population synthesis models</h3>
								<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Newman, Sophie L.; Lovell, Christopher C.; Maraston, Claudia; Giavalisco, Mauro; Roper, William J.; Saxena, Aayush; Vijayan, Aswin P.; Wilkins, Stephen M.</p>
								<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The James Webb Space Telescope has ushered in an era of abundant high-redshift observations of young stellar populations characterized by strong emission lines, motivating us to integrate nebular emission into the new Maraston stellar population model which incorporates the latest Geneva stellar evolutionary tracks for massive stars with rotation. We use the photoionization code Cloudy to obtain the emergent nebular continuum and line emission for a range of modelling parameters, then compare our results to observations on various emission line diagnostic diagrams. We carry out a detailed comparison with several other models in the literature assuming different input physics, including modified prescriptions for stellar evolution and the inclusion of binary stars, and find close agreement in the H β, H α, [N II] λ6583, and [S II] λ6731 luminosities between the models. However, we find significant differences in lines with high ionization energies, such as He II λ1640 and [O III] λ5007, due to large variations in the hard ionizing photon production rates. The models differ by a maximum of Q^[OIII]λ5007=6×10^9 s−1 M−1⊙, where these differences are mostly caused by the assumed stellar rotation and effective temperatures for the Wolf Rayet phase. Interestingly, rotation and uncorrected effective temperatures in our single star population models alone generate [O III] ionizing photon production rates higher than models including binary stars with ages between 1 to 8 Myr. These differences highlight the dependence of derived properties from SED fitting on the assumed model, as well as the sensitivity of predictions from cosmological simulations.</p>
