								<h2>Hi!</h2>
								<p> I am working towards a PhD at the Institute of Cosmology & Gravitation (ICG) at the University of Portsmouth, 
                  learning how to generate synthetic observations for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). 
                  Throughout my Master's project at the Unversity of Southampton I also developed an interest in 
                  using microlensing by compact objects to explore accretion disks.
                </p>

								<p> I grew up in a single-parent family in Grays, Essex, a low-income area where physics education is particuarly poor. I became excited 
                  about physics around the age of 15 after watching documentaries on space missions and eventually learned more 
                  about astronomy and astrophysics too. In 2019 I started my MPhys degree in Physics at the University of 
                  Southampton, graduating with 1st class honours in 2023. I then begun my PhD later that year at the Institute of
                  Cosmology & Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth with Claudia Maraston and Christopher Lovell as my supervisors.
                </p>

								<p> When I am not busy coding, you can find me baking various sweet goods (IG: @physicistbakery), crocheting, doing various
                  other crafts, watching F1, enjoying nature, or hanging out with friends from my church family.
                </p>
